<h2 align="center"> HOGS_AI for Arma 3 Epoch Altis</h2>
=======
This system is for use with [Arma 3: Epoch Mod] (http://epochmod.com/) and has locations specifically for
the island of Altis. This AI system also uses a headless client. If you do not know how to set up a headless 
client, you can find more information [on the Epoch forums](http://epochmod.com/forum/index.php?/topic/29541-a3-epoch-headless-clients-walkthrough-updateddec-22nd/), and [on Github.](https://github.com/hogscraper/A3_EPOCH_Headless_Client)

Hogs AI is about being a balance to most larger AI systems. In most systems a large number of AI spawn
around a large object. This presents its own set of challenges and weakness so I wanted a system that
spawned smaller groups around a larger area for players to hunt down and that would be used in concert
with already existing AI systems. The rewards, AI and locations can all be completely costomized in this 
system so if you enjoy those large type missions you could recreate them in this system as well. You can find
more information on this system [here](http://epochmod.com/forum/index.php?/topic/30682-hogs-ai-choose-your-own-mission-system-fixed-post-123114/#entry187566)

Please let me know if there is anything that needs to be fixed or updated or changed and I will gladly 
look it over. Also, please note that this code is not formatted properly at this point as it is still a work in
progress.

Thank you for your time!
